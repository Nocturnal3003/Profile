                    <p>I think education is a fundamental right. There were always children in the neighbourhood of my college that could not attend school for various reasons. I wanted to teach them whatever knowledge I have so that those children that cannot go to school could experience the joy of learning. I am eager to spread all the knowledge I have to anyone who wants to learn it. I believe in the motto "Each one, Teach one". So, even if I'm teaching a small fraction of student, I think I'm helping those children go towards a better life.</p>

                    <p>I have always loved nature. When I was in 3rd grade, I saw a video of how our small actions affects the entire earth. I always though being a part of campaings that will help me spread this message to more and more people. I used to make handmade posters that could raise awarness about the topic. These posters were usually put up in malls and public spaces to make a bigger impact. I have also volunteered in campaigns that plant trees during these environment day celebrations. I believe if all of us work towards living more sustainably, we may be able to save our environment from any further damage.</p>

                    <p>I feel that Smoking is truly an injurious activity. It not only affects the person who is smoking but also the people who are around them. Since I saw a lot of people that used to somke, I wanted to raise awareness about how harmful it is to smoke. Consequently, I have volunteered in Anti-Smoking Society,Qatars activities to spread awareness about this issue. I have also made awareness posters and participated in their debate contests to play my part in spreading awareness about smoking..</p>
